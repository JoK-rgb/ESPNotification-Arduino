This is the companion project for this Android app: https://github.com/JoK-rgb/ESPNotification-Android

This is based on BLE library -> UART example 

For demonstration purposes I connected a SSD1306 Oled to pins 6 (SDA) and 7 (SCL) of my ESP32.
I used the ESP32-C6-Mini as the microcontroller.
The ESP32 will print incoming notifications sent via Bluetooth to the screen.
